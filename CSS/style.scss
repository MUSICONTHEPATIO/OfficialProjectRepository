// THINGS THAT STILL NEED TO BE DONE (by priority)
// 1. Title page subtitle 
// 2. Finish the styling of the results page
// 3. Responsive
// 4. Link icons in the title page to websites
// 5. Footer background colour (thought I would wait until we decided what the background of the results page would be)
// 6. Take off fixed values in the inputs and insert placeholder text
// 7. Hovers on buttons
// 8. Change hero image to something not off of google (TK said she had access to an image website) if not, credit where the image is from in the footer
